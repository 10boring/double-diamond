# probe

The **fifth move**, the Lean **Build-Measure-Learn** step added onto the Double Diamond (design
thinking): the four D's end at `decide`; `probe` de-risks the chosen idea before it is specified. It
runs after `decide` (which selected the idea) and before superpowers `brainstorming` (which
specifies it). Pure design thinking stops at Deliver; `probe` makes the Lean validate loop explicit
(the operator may call a probe an *experiment* — same thing). The rule that holds it in place: **an
experiment must be able to fail**, and its pass/fail threshold is set **before** the result is seen.

## Core principle

De-risk the pick before you spec it. `probe` finds the assumption most likely to kill the chosen
idea and designs the **cheapest honest experiment** of it, with judgment fixed **in advance**: the
pass/fail threshold is written down before the experiment runs, so the result can't be rationalized
after the fact.

**`probe` designs the experiment AND offers to run it.** Design and execute don't cleanly separate
here, and pretending they do is a mistake. Light recon and measurement — desk research, a quick
`curl`, an API call, a driven browser session, a web search, a concierge / Wizard-of-Oz / fake
door — run **inline**; offer to run them whenever you can, the operator decides how. Only a *real
product build* routes out, to `brainstorming` → plan as a scoped, **throwaway** validation build
that gets its own scope-gate so it can't silently become the product.

**An experiment is not the product.** A probe is a throwaway test of one assumption. The *pipeline*
terminates one level further out, in a **minimal viable deliverable** — an **MVP** (minimal viable
product) for a whole product, an **MVF** (minimal viable feature) for a feature. That minimal
deliverable is the first *real* thing shipped to real users, and it doubles as the big
Build-Measure-Learn probe — but it is a product/feature, built via `brainstorming` → plan →
implement, never a throwaway experiment. Don't conflate the two.

## Precondition

A **chosen idea** must exist in the working file's `## Decide` (`discover` creates the file in the
working repo at `docs/designthinking/<slug>.md`, else `~/.claude/design/<slug>.md`, gated by its
`Status` field). Require a chosen idea, then:
- `Status: probing` — proceed.
- `Status` **lower**, or the file missing — stop and point to `decide` (or `discover`/`define`/
  `develop` if the upstream isn't done).
- `Status` **higher** (e.g. `ready-to-specify`) but no `## Probe` was ever run — `decide` handed
  straight to a spec and skipped this move — **back `Status` to `probing` and run**. Backing into a
  skipped phase, or re-running one already done, is legitimate iteration, not an error.

## When to skip it

High bar by design, because the failure this move prevents is skipping validation too eagerly. Skip
only when **no assumption is both high-risk and uncertain** (nothing a cheap experiment would
change), or the operator **explicitly accepts a named untestable risk** and it is recorded in
`## Probe`. Being told "just build it" does not release the gate; the operator may still knowingly
proceed on an unvalidated bet, recorded as such.

## Workflow

1. **Read the chosen idea and the surfaced assumptions** from `## Decide` and `## Define`.
   `discover`/`define` and `decide` already surfaced the assumptions and the discriminator, reuse
   them; do not re-discover.
2. **Rank the assumptions by risk × uncertainty**, from independent sources, operator first so you
   don't anchor:
   - **Operator first.** Ask what, if it turned out false, would kill the idea.
   - **Parallel agents.** Fan out 3–4 subagents to **red-team**, each blind to the others, on "the
     thing most likely to kill this idea is X"; pool and dedup. (If parallel agents aren't
     available, run the lenses yourself sequentially, each a separate blind pass.)
   - **Agent agreement is breadth, not evidence.** Four LLMs share priors, so a unanimous panel can
     be confidently wrong; a single operator or real-user fact outranks it. Use the agents to
     *widen* the candidate assumptions, never to *validate* one.
   - The **riskiest** = highest risk × highest uncertainty. Drop what is already known-true or
     low-stakes.
3. **Confirm the assumption's framing with the operator, then write the test card** into `## Probe`.
   The first framing is often architecturally naive — you may be about to test the wrong thing — so
   have the operator confirm *what* is being tested before you commit the card:
   - **Hypothesis** — the assumption stated so it can be false.
   - **Cheapest honest experiment** — prefer **zero-build** (desk research, concierge / Wizard-of-Oz,
     fake door, a measurement against a live source); only if none can answer it, a scoped throwaway
     build handed to `brainstorming` → plan.
   - **Metric** — what the experiment measures.
   - **Pass/fail threshold, written now, before it runs.**
4. **Offer to run it; run what you can; record what you find.** Run inline whatever you can
   (recon, measurement, API calls, a driven browser). Route only a *real product build* out to
   `brainstorming` → plan (throwaway, scope-gated). Record the result in `## Probe` as you go — the
   working file is a **living document**, revise it in place rather than only stacking new layers.
5. **Record the verdict** in `## Probe` (pass / fail / inconclusive + the learning) and branch:
   - **Pass** → set `Status: ready-to-specify`; the idea goes to `brainstorming` → plan → implement
     to build the **MVP / MVF** (the minimal viable deliverable that doubles as the big probe).
   - **Fail** → move `Status` back to `discovering` or `developing` with the learning; the idea, the
     framing, or the option set was wrong.
   - **Inconclusive** → design a cheaper or sharper experiment; don't spec on an unresolved bet.

## Reset

A failed probe is the method working: it sends you back to `develop` (wrong idea) or `discover` /
`define` (wrong problem) with a learning you didn't have before. Moving `Status` backward is
iteration, not failure.

## What it does NOT do

- **Doesn't build the product / MVP / MVF** — the minimal deliverable is built *after* a pass, via
  `brainstorming` → plan → implement; a probe's own throwaway validation build (if any) is
  scope-gated and never becomes the product.
- **Doesn't treat agent consensus as evidence** — a unanimous panel is breadth; operator/user data
  outranks it.
- **Doesn't decide for the operator** — it surfaces the riskiest assumption and holds the go/no-go;
  the operator may accept a named untestable risk and proceed, recorded.
- **Doesn't specify** — the chosen idea goes to `brainstorming` only after a pass; `probe` writes
  no spec, plan, or code.
- **Doesn't rank from one mind** — solicit the operator and fan out blind red-team agents first.

## Common mistakes

| Mistake | Right |
|---------|-------|
| Speccing straight after `decide` | Probe the riskiest assumption first |
| An experiment that can only confirm | It must be able to fail |
| Reading the result, then deciding what "pass" meant | Threshold set before it runs |
| Refusing to run a cheap test you could run | Offer to run it inline; only a real product build routes out |
| Treating a unanimous agent panel as validation | Agent agreement is breadth; operator/user data outranks it |
| Writing the card before confirming what's tested | Confirm the assumption's framing with the operator first |
| Building the MVP and calling it "the probe" | The probe tests one assumption cheaply; the MVP/MVF comes after, via plan → implement |
| Calling the MVP a throwaway experiment (or vice versa) | An experiment is a throwaway test; the MVP/MVF is the minimal *real* deliverable |
| Skipping probe because it "obviously works" | Skip only if nothing is high-risk AND uncertain |
